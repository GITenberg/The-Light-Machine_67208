<p>Tubby took his feet off the fender of the little stove in the back room 
of O’Connor’s Grocery and glared at his two friends aggressively.</p> 

<p>“That ain’t so,” he declared. “That ain’t so, nohow.”</p> 

<p>“Well <i>he</i> said,” the first man repeated, “as how that’s just the 
way it is—that light travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in 
a second.”</p> 

<p>“’Taint so,” said Tubby. “That’s too fast for anything to go.”</p> 

<p>“That’s what he said,” the first man reiterated imperturbably. “One 
hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in a second— that’s what he 
said.”</p> 

<p>“Well ’taint so,” Tubby repeated; he rose to his feet suddenly. “You 
can see light, can’t you?” he demanded.</p> 

<p>“’Course I can see light. I ain’t blind.”</p> 

<p>“Can you see a automobile when it’s going past a hundred miles a hour?” 
Tubby pointed a fat little forefinger directly into the first man’s 
face.</p> 

<p>“Why, why, yes,” said the first man, surprised into confusion.</p> 

<p>“And can you see the <i>spokes</i> of a automobile wheel when it’s 
going past a hundred miles a hour?”</p> 

<p>The first man thought a moment. “Why, why, no,” he said finally.</p> 

<p>Tubby lowered his forefinger. “Then that proves it ain’t so,” he 
declared triumphantly. “Nor you couldn’t see a bullet if I shot it past 
your nose, could you?”</p> 

<p>“You couldn’t, Jake,” the second man put in.</p> 

<p>“No, you couldn’t,” said Tubby. “Nor you couldn’t see light if it went 
that fast neither. Ain’t I right? Could you?”</p> 

<p>“He’s right, Jake,” said the second man.</p> 

<p>Tubby sat down.</p> 

<p>“Well, <i>he</i> said,” the first man resumed unabashed—“he said as 
how light travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in a second. 
And furthermore, and in addition, he said as how some of the stars were so 
far away that it takes the light hundreds and hundreds of years just 
getting here from them.”</p> 

<p>“It was all in the movie,” said the second man wearily. “‘The Wonders 
of Light’—I remember it.”</p> 

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> don’t believe it,” said Tubby. “Because I know it ain’t so—not 
none of it.”</p> 

<p>He stood up again; then with sudden thought he waddled across the room 
to the open window.</p> 

<p>“Come here,” he said, commandingly; the two other men joined him.</p> 

<p>“Ain’t them stars up there?” he asked. He pointed through the open 
casement to a brilliant, cloudless summer evening sky.</p> 

<p>“Yes—them’s stars all right,” the first man agreed. “If that’s what you 
mean.”</p> 

<p>“That <i>ain’t</i> what I mean,” said Tubby. “I said, ‘Ain’t them stars 
up there?’ Are they up there, or ain’t they? That’s what I want to 
know.”</p> 

<p>“They’re up there all right, Jake,” said the second man.</p> 

<p>“If you can see them, mustn’t they be there?” Tubby persisted.</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said the first man. “When you can see them they must be 
there.”</p> 

<p>“Then,” said Tubby—he paused impressively—“then the light of them must 
be here and there at the same time. Am I right?”</p> 

<p>“He’s right, Jake,” said the second man. “’Cause if it took the light a 
hundred years to get here we couldn’t see them for a hundred years yet. Am 
I right?”</p> 

<p>The first man went back to the stove. Tubby and the second man joined 
him after a moment.</p> 

<p>“I ain’t telling you what <i>I</i> think,” the first man remarked. “I’m 
telling you what <i>he</i> said—”</p> 

<p>“It ain’t got no sense,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“<i>I’m</i> going to the movies,” said the second man abruptly. “Come 
on.”</p> 

<p>“Not me,” said Tubby. “I ate too much. I’m going to sleep.”</p> 

<p>“It’s ‘The Burning of Rome,’” said the first man. “Nero playing the 
piano while the city burns. Come on. It’s good—I seen the pictures.”</p> 

<p>And reluctantly Tubby allowed himself to be led away.</p> 

<p>The little Moving Picture Theater was hot and stuffy; Tubby found an 
aisle seat with his friends, near the back. For a quarter of an hour or 
more he sat blinking at the flickering screen. The Topical Review 
interested him not at all; he yawned and squeezed his fat little body 
lower into the hard narrow seat.</p> 

<p>Then the picture changed. It was not “The Burning of Rome” yet, but a 
short picture, evidently science. Tubby frowned at it in silence.</p> 

<p>The first man nudged him. “Wake up,” he said. “Here’s a astronomical 
picture about the stars. Wake up. It’ll be good. ‘The Burning of
Rome’s’ next.”</p> 

<p>“I ain’t asleep.” Tubby whispered back. “I’m thinking.”</p> 

<p>The wonders of celestial space were unfolding before Tubby’s eyes. But 
he hardly saw them. He was thinking of what Jake had said—those tremendous 
figures Jake had reeled off to him. What was it he had said? One hundred 
and eighty-six thousand miles in a second. There were sixty seconds in a 
minute, and sixty minutes in an hour! That would be—</p> 

<p>“’Taint so,” he muttered to himself doggedly.</p> 

<p>He felt a light touch on his arm and looked up to see a little man 
standing beside him in the aisle. In the dim light Tubby could not see the 
little man very well; but he <i>could</i> see that he did not know 
him.</p> 

<p>The little man bent down toward Tubby’s ear.</p> 

<p>“I want to talk to you,” he whispered.</p> 

<p>“What about?” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>The little man shook his head. “I can’t talk in here. Come outside for 
a moment.”</p> 

<p>Tubby hesitated.</p> 

<p>“It’s very important,” the little man added. “You must come—just for a 
moment. I’ve wanted to see you for a very long time.”</p> 

<p>Tubby clambered to his feet; his two friends, absorbed in the picture 
before them, did not notice him leave. In silence he followed the stranger 
back up the aisle to the lighted theater lobby.</p> 

<p>“I’ve wanted to see you for a long time,” the little man repeated. 
Tubby could see now he was a very little man, with a thin, frail body and 
a very big head set upon a long spindly neck. His hair was snow-white and 
long about his ears. His yellow face was seamed with lines, but most of it 
was hidden by flowing side-whiskers and by a pair of huge iron-rimmed 
spectacles. He wore a long black frock coat that hung from his thin 
shoulders like a shroud.</p> 

<p>“I’m a professor,” said the stranger. He held out a shriveled, taloned 
hand. “A Professor of Light,” he added impressively.</p> 

<p>“Oh,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“My name is Obadiah Oats.”</p> 

<p>Tubby shook hands. “Mine’s Tubby,” he said. “Pleased to meet you.”</p> 

<p>The professor put on his high hat, which made him nearly as tall as 
Tubby.</p> 

<p>“I want to consult you on a matter of very great importance to both of 
us,” he said slowly.</p> 

<p>Tubby waited.</p> 

<p>“About light,” the professor added. He linked his arm in Tubby’s 
confidentially. “I need your help. They tell me you’re the smartest man in 
town. I wanted to find you. With a brain like yours and mine—”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby breathlessly, when the professor paused.</p> 

<p>“My laboratory’s right across the street,” said the little man. “I’ll 
show you.” Tubby followed the professor out of the theater, through a 
little doorway across the street and up several flights of rickety stairs 
into a room on the top floor of the house.</p> 

<p>“This is where I work,” said the professor. “Sit down.”</p> 

<p>It was a large room with endless row of bottles upon tiers of shelves 
lining its walls. Several long tables stood about, and Tubby saw they were 
crowded with curious apparatus—little tubes in racks, microscopes, 
triangular pieces of glass with candles behind them, and several 
contrivances of wheels and weights that looked like clock works. In the 
exact center of the room was one larger apparatus of a sort Tubby had 
never seen before; it seemed very complicated and he stared at it with 
awe. He could make nothing out of it except that part of it was a huge 
telescope, extending up through the skylight of the room. He glanced 
upward, and there, through a narrow, open slit in the glass, he could see 
the stars shining.</p> 

<p>“That’s a Light Machine,” said the professor, following his glance. 
“There’s only one in the world, and there it is.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“It’s the most wonderful machine that was ever built,” the professor 
went on softly. “I built it; and now <i>you</i> are going to help me make 
money out of it.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “How?”</p> 

<p>“That’s what <i>you</i> are going to tell <i>me</i>. Don’t you see? I 
am a man of science—you are a business man. That’s the difference between 
us.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“First I’ll have to explain. You have a head for figures, of 
course?”</p> 

<p>“No—yes,” said Tubby. “Of course.”</p> 

<p>“But you don’t know much about light?”</p> 

<p>“Yes—no,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“Naturally. How could you. Nobody does—but me. And I know all about
it—<i>all</i>.” He emphasized the last word impressively. “And now I’m going 
to tell it to you.”</p> 

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Tubby, and waited.</p> 

<p>“All my life,” began the professor—he spoke softly; his eyes, fixed on 
Tubby seemed staring at dim, distant spaces—“all my life—since I was a 
little boy—I have been studying the properties of light. It is a very 
wonderful thing—you realize that, do you not—the most wonderful thing in 
the whole of science?”</p> 

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>The professor drew in a deep breath, like a long sigh reversed. 
“Light,” he began again, “is a vibratory wave in the Ether. You know what 
the Ether is?”</p> 

<p>“No,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“It is like air. But you cannot breathe it. It exists everywhere—even 
in the outermost realms of Space. Now do you understand?”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“Light is vibration of the Ether,” the professor went on in his droning 
voice. “Its vibrations travel through the Ether at the rate of one hundred 
and eighty-six thousand three hundred and twenty-four miles a second.”</p> 

<p>“I know <i>that</i>,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“You are a learned man,” the professor said admiringly. “You have a 
wonderful mind. I knew you had—they said so.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “Go on.”</p> 

<p>The professor jerked his little body upright in his chair suddenly, so 
suddenly that Tubby started violently with fright.</p> 

<p>“How long is a second?” the professor asked aggressively.</p> 

<p>“Why—tick-tick. That’s it,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>The professor relaxed in his chair. “You <i>are</i> a clever man. You 
will have your little joke.</p> 

<p>“But we must be serious. I will tell you how long a second is. It is 
exactly one-thirty-one millionth, five hundred and fifty-eight thousandth, 
one hundred and forty-ninth part of a year.”</p> 

<p>“Oh,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“Do you know what a year is?”</p> 

<p>“Three hundred and sixty-five days,” said Tubby promptly.</p> 

<p>The professor smiled again. “A year is the time it takes the Earth to 
revolve once around the Sun. Thus you see there are 31,558,149 seconds in 
a year—which is a little more than 365¼ days.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “I see.”</p> 

<p>“Now to find out how far light travels in a year we simply take its 
speed per second and multiply it by sixty. That is its speed per minute. 
Multiply that by sixty gives it speed per hour and so on up to a day or a 
year. Do you understand?”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “How—how far does it go in a year?”</p> 

<p>The professor raised his hand.</p> 

<p>“<i>That</i> is a very simple problem—only mental arithmetic for 
me. Wait. Let us go further.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “Go on.”</p> 

<p>“The distance Light travels in one year is called a Light-year. Now, 
some of the stars are so far away that it takes light many centuries to 
come from them, traveling at that speed I have just mentioned. Thus we 
measure their distance from us as so many hundred Light-years. Do you 
see?”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “How—how many miles away from us is the farthest 
star—the very farthest?”</p> 

<p>The professor leaped to his feet. “Ah, I was expecting you to ask 
that.” His face was beaming. “You <i>are</i> a clever man. But I’m ready 
for you. I figured it all out this afternoon and wrote it down. I’ll show 
you.”</p> 

<p>He led Tubby to a corner of the room. Tubby saw a perfectly enormous 
roll of narrow paper tape, like the tape that comes from a stock ticker, 
or is rolled up around baby ribbon. Only this roll was bigger than he was. 
It was hung vertically on a spindle, which had a handle to rotate it so 
that the tape could be unwound and wound again easily. A few feet away 
there was a similar spindle, but empty.</p> 

<p>“I wrote it down for you,” the professor repeated—“the distance in 
miles of the furthest star from the Earth. I wrote it down—on this.”</p> 

<p>He took the loose end of the tape and reeling off a few feet hooked the 
end onto the empty spindle.</p> 

<p>“Watch closely,” he said. “I’m going to show you the number.”</p> 

<p>He started to wind up the tape on the empty spindle. Tubby stood close 
beside the strip of tape stretching the space between the two spindles; 
it passed directly under his face.</p> 

<p>“Watch closely,” said the professor again. “There comes the first of 
it.” Tubby saw a row of little digits start on the tape. The first three 
were 154. Then after the comma began a string of ciphers; after each three 
ciphers was another comma. The moving tape carried this endless row of 
little ciphers swiftly under Tubby’s nose. He stared at them fascinated. 
Faster and faster they flew by as the roll of tape wound up on the spindle 
the professor was turning. For half an hour he turned briskly. Then the 
row of ciphers stopped just as the other end of the tape fluttered off the 
unwinding spindle.</p> 

<p>The professor leaned against the wall, breathing hard.</p> 

<p>“That—was—the—number,” he gasped.</p>

<p>Tubby blinked. “What—what number was it?” he asked finally.</p> 

<p>The professor recovered his breath and sat down again in his chair 
wearily.</p> 

<p>“It was one hundred and fifty-four zin-tillions,” he answered. “The 
largest number that has ever been written down. Wrote it down this 
afternoon.”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said Tubby. “It <i>was</i> a big number.”</p> 

<p>The professor pulled at his side-whiskers thoughtfully. “We must get 
on,” he said. “Now you understand how far the stars are away. And how fast 
light travels. That brings us to my Light Machine.”</p>

<p>Tubby sat up with interest. “To the Light Machine. Yes, go on.”</p> 

<p>“As you can see,” the professor continued. “I know all about Light—I am 
its master. No one in the world knows as much about Light as I do. And 
only one man in the world thinks he does.” The professor’s eyes gleamed 
vindictively. “Ah, how I hate him, that man!”</p> 

<p>“Who?” Tubby asked with interest. “What is his name?”</p> 

<p>“His name is Einstein,” answered the professor. “I hate him—I loathe 
him—I despise him.”</p> 

<p>“Oh,” said Tubby. “I’m sorry.”</p> 

<p>“But he cannot harm <i>me</i>. I’m too clever for him. And <i>you</i> 
will help me. We still have time—he cannot prove anything yet.”</p> 

<p>“No—yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>The professor stood up. “Let us get on with my invention. <i>Then</i> 
you’ll see what a wonderful man I am. I will be brief.”</p>

<p>Tubby joined him beside the telescope in the center of the room.</p> 

<p>“What you must understand first,” said the professor, “is <i>my</i> 
theory of Light.” Tubby waited.</p> 

<p>“No light is ever destroyed,” the professor continued. “It passes 
beyond our vision, that is all. But it always exists somewhere, in the 
outer realms of Space.”</p>

<p>“That’s where it goes when it goes out,” Tubby put in. “Ain’t I right?”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said the professor. “That’s where it goes—out into the realms of 
Space.</p> 

<p>“Now what you must understand is that light can be reflected, 
refracted, polarized, but never destroyed.” He pointed to his instruments 
on one of the tables. “<i>I</i> can do all those things to it—and a thousand 
more—but I cannot destroy it.”</p> 

<p>“Right,” said Tubby. “But if you put it out you can’t never get it 
back, can you now?”</p> 

<p>The professor beamed on him genially. “Your brain works too keenly,” he 
said. “You anticipate me. No, <i>I</i> cannot get it back. But it comes back. 
That’s just the point—it comes back. That’s what nobody in the world knows 
except me—me and you.</p> 

<p>“The sun,” he went on, “gives us most of our light—it gets here to the 
earth from the sun in a few minutes. The moon gives us reflected sunlight. 
It is the same light, only it comes to us from the sun by way of the moon. 
It takes a little longer that way.”</p> 

<p>“How much?” Tubby asked.</p> 

<p>“Not much—just a few seconds—the moon is not far away. Now all this 
light that strikes the earth is reflected back into space. In a hundred 
years—less or more according to the distance—it strikes the different 
stars. There it mingles with other light. And then, mark me well, and
then”—the professor paused impressively—“then in another hundred years it 
comes back to us again—the same light—mixed with other light of 
course—but some of the same light we had two hundred years before. Do you 
understand?”</p> 

<p>“No—yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“That,” said the professor, “is the <i>Oats Theory of the Rationality 
of Light</i>. I call it that because it <i>is</i> rational—it is in 
accordance with all known physical laws.</p> 

<p>“Some others I could name”—the professor’s voice shook with suppressed 
passion; his eyes gleamed again wickedly—“some others are not so 
scrupulous. <i>Their</i> theories do <i>not</i> coincide with recognized 
physical laws—they transgress them all. Mere astronomical 
outcasts—mathematical lepers—scientific pariahs—”</p> 

<p>“Oh—you mean that other guy?” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>The professor calmed himself with an effort. He pulled a huge black 
silk handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his dripping forehead.</p> 

<p>“We won’t talk of him,” he said after a moment.</p> 

<p>“No, we better leave him out of it,” Tubby agreed. “Ain’t I right?”</p> 

<p>The professor nodded. “Now we come to <i>my</i> great discovery. I’ll 
tell you about that now.</p> 

<p>“When this sunlight is reflected from the moon to us, it brings with it 
an image of the moon, which was not in the light when it left the sun. Do 
you understand?”</p> 

<p>“No—yes,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“That’s why we can see the moon—the light brings us the image. All 
light carries an image of something—that’s why we can see things.</p> 

<p>“Now when light leaves the earth and goes out into space it takes with 
it an image of the earth and everything that is happening on the 
earth.”</p> 

<p>“Right,” said Tubby. “Go on.”</p> 

<p>“Now some of this light may have to travel a hundred years before it 
reaches a star. When it does it mixes with other light and is reflected 
back in another hundred years to us. But—mark you this—but it still 
carries the image of the earth and what happened on the earth when it was 
here.”</p> 

<p>“But you don’t see <i>that</i>,” said Tubby. “We see the star. Ain’t I 
right?”</p> 

<p>“Yes,” said the professor. “Of course you’re right. And the reason we 
see the star is because that image is the last one the light got. That is 
predominate. All the others are there—but they are hidden away beneath the 
star image.”</p> 

<p>“Oh,” said Tubby.</p> 

<p>“Nobody ever knew they were there, and so of course nobody ever tried 
to get them out. But <i>I</i> knew they were there— 
that’s the <i>Oats Theory of the Rationality of Light</i>. And I have got 
them out!” His voice rose in triumph. “That’s the Light Machine—the 
greatest invention in the history of the world!”</p> 

<p>“Oh, the Light Machine,” said Tubby, when the professor paused.</p> 

<p>“The Oats Light Machine—here it is—the only one in the world. I’ll 
show you at once.”</p> 

<p>He switched off the lights. The room was quite dark except for a little 
beam of white light that seemed to thread its way through the intricate 
system of mirrors and prisms of the Light Machine. Tubby could not see 
where this light came from or where it went to. But he saw distinctly that 
it turned several corners and was alternately broad and narrow. It was 
white throughout most of its course; but in one short span it was a dark, 
angry red, and in another a deep, beautiful purple.</p> 

<p>“The Light Machine,” the Professor began; his fingers caressed one of 
its little reflectors lovingly, “is able to extract from light all the 
images it holds, no matter how long they have been there.”</p> 

<p>“That’s wonderful, ain’t it?” said Tubby with admiration.</p> 

<p>“Yes. Let me show you. Here is the telescope. I train it on a star—a 
star, mark you, that is not a sun, but that shines by reflected light. 
This beam of starlight, contains moonlight, earthlight, sunlight 
(<i>our</i> sunlight, you know)—and the light from millions of other suns. 
The starlight comes out from here”—he touched the lower end of the 
telescope.</p> 

<p>“Now you see this ray of my own created light passes directly in front 
of where the starlight comes out—that’s where they mix.”</p> 

<p>Tubby saw the little beam of white light crossed at right angles to the 
telescope eyepiece and passed very close to it.</p> 

<p>“This light of my own is created by burning zonogen—a gas I discovered 
myself.</p> 

<p>“From this point, where the starlight joins it, my 
ray goes to the spectroscope”—he touched another portion of the Light 
Machine—“and it is polarized here. These”—he indicated a long row of tiny 
black compartments; Tubby could see the beam of light entering at one end 
and emerging at the other—“these are my image extractors. Each takes from 
the light some of its images—leaving finally only the earthlight and the 
images that belong to it.</p> 

<p>“There are many other processes—<i>some</i> day you will understand 
them all. But for now—let me show you the result.</p> 

<p>“The pure earthlight passes last of all into my projector. See it 
here?” He laid his hand on what looked to Tubby something like a magic 
lantern.</p> 

<p>“My operating power is electricity.” He turned a switch. Tubby first 
heard a low hum and then a whirring, clicking sound.</p> 

<p>“This projector magnifies the image—throws it up on a screen.” He 
pointed to the wall; Tubby saw a small square of canvas hung on the 
wall.</p> 

<p>“Now then,” the professor continued, his voice trembling with emotion, 
“that star my telescope is pointing at is now exactly nine hundred and 
twenty-seven and one half Light-years away. That means that eighteen 
hundred and fifty-five years ago to-night the light we are getting back 
now from that star left the earth. Do you know what was happening eighteen 
hundred and fifty-five years ago to-night?”</p> 

<p>“No,” said Tubby. “Yes. Lots of things.”</p> 

<p>“I can pick anything I want from the light,” the professor answered. “I 
merely tune my instruments differently. Like wireless, you know—it’s all a 
matter of vibration. I have picked the most important thing that was 
happening—the ‘Burning of Rome’!”</p> 

<p>He turned another switch; the clicking sound grew louder. On the sheet, 
Tubby saw a great city in flames. He seemed to be standing on a hill, 
looking down at it. In the foreground he saw the young Roman Emperor, with 
his mistress, his friends and his music, as they reclined at ease, 
watching the destruction. Tubby stared for a long time, fascinated.</p> 

<p>“You are looking into the past,” he heard the professor’s droning voice 
saying.</p> 

<p>“All that has been stored up in the light all these years. It is light 
itself—the work of God, not of man.</p> 

<p>“That is Nero sitting there. No one living to-day on this earth has 
ever seen him before. But there he is—Nero the Cruel, Emperor of Rome. 
<i>We</i> see him, you and I, for we are looking into the past—looking 
into the past.” The professor’s voice trailed off into silence.</p> 

<p>Tubby stared breathlessly. His heart was beating fast; he was trembling 
all over. He felt suddenly a little faint. He was in a cold sweat, and he 
sat down abruptly in a little wooden chair beside the Light Machine.</p> 

<p>The scene before him was very vivid; he could almost hear the Emperor’s 
music. Why, he <i>did</i> hear music! Funny! The professor had not 
mentioned that.</p> 

<p>The clicking noise grew louder; the scene before him was so bright he 
could see nothing else around. It was very dark, and very close and 
stuffy. Where was the professor? Why didn’t he say something about the 
music?</p> 

<p>Tubby grew a little frightened. He shifted his feet uneasily. The 
little chair in which he was sitting was very uncomfortable. It cramped 
him; his back hurt. After a little while the scene before him slowly 
faded. The lights in the room flashed on; a rustling, and a shuffling of 
many feet sounded in his ears.</p> 

<p>Tubby sat up abruptly, blinking in the sudden light.</p> 

<p>“Some kid, that Nero—eh, Jake?” said a voice beside him.</p> 

<p>“You said it. Some picture. Come on, Tubby, let’s go home,” said the 
first man.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
